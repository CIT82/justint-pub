    <p>Looking through the MDM website, I found a couple of fun things to play with. First, to center my text and picture, I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox" target="_blank">flexbox</a> with the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">cheatsheet</a> for help. Next, I did some research on using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/class" target="_blank">classes</a> and<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/id" target="_blank"> IDs</a> to identify different elements. While I was able to implement them here, I’m not exactly spun up on the industry’s best practices for when to use each, so I’ll ask ChatGPT to explain and put the answer below. Lastly, I used border-radius to make my picture round. All together, I think it came out nicely.</p>
    <h2>Classes vs Ids</h2>
    <p>In HTML and CSS, classes and IDs are both used to style and identify elements, but they serve slightly different purposes. A class is reusable and can be applied to multiple elements on a page, making it great for shared styles (for example, giving several buttons the same look). An ID, on the other hand, must be unique — it’s meant to identify a single, specific element (like the main header or a unique section). In CSS, you select classes with a . (dot) and IDs with a # (hash). A good rule of thumb is to use classes for general styling and IDs when you need to target one specific element.</p>
