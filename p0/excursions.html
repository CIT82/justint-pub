    <section class="mb-4">
      <p>
        One of the best things about a short Carnival cruise down the Mexican Riviera isn’t just the onboard fun,
        but the excursions waiting at each stop. A four-day itinerary typically sails from Long Beach, spends a day
        at Catalina Island, docks in Ensenada, and finishes with a sea day before returning to California. It’s a
        perfect “sampler” cruise: just enough time to dip into adventure, relaxation, and cultural flavor without
        needing a week off work. And the excursion menu Carnival offers makes the ports feel twice as rich.
      </p>
      <p>
        On my first 4-day Mexican cruise, I treated each port day as a choose-your-own-adventure. Catalina was all
        about exploring the island vibe; Ensenada was a food and culture feast; the sea day was where I indulged in
        pure relaxation. Here’s what I learned, what I tried, and what’s still on my wish list for next time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Catalina Island -->
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="h4">Catalina Island: A Playground Just Offshore</h2>
      <p>
        Catalina Island, just 22 miles off the California coast, feels like a world away the second you step ashore.
        The town of Avalon is dotted with pastel houses, golf carts whirring by like taxis, and the famous round
        Casino building looming over the bay. The excursions here fall into two main categories: <em>adventure in
        the water</em> or <em>adventure on the island</em>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Snorkeling and Semi-Sub Adventures</h3>
      <p>
        For water lovers, Carnival sells guided snorkeling tours in Lover’s Cove, one of the island’s most protected
        marine areas. The water is cold but startlingly clear, and the kelp forests sway like curtains in the tide.
        Bright orange Garibaldi fish flash by in schools, and if you’re lucky, you might spot sea lions lounging on
        nearby rocks. I booked this on my first visit, and it felt surreal to swim so close to such lively sea life
        just a short ferry ride from L.A.
      </p>
      <p>
        If snorkeling feels too intense, there’s the semi-submarine tour. You climb into a vessel with windows below
        the waterline and watch fish swim past without ever getting wet. Families with kids loved this — it was like
        an aquarium tour where the walls moved around you.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">On-Land Options: Jeeps, Ziplines, and Views</h3>
      <p>
        Not a water person? Carnival’s catalog for Catalina also includes jeep eco-tours that take you into the
        rugged interior of the island. Here, bison (yes, bison!) roam wild, descendants of animals brought over for
        old Hollywood films. The jeep bumps over dusty roads, climbing to views that stretch across the Pacific.
        For thrill-seekers, the Catalina Zip Line Eco Tour is a must. Five separate lines carry you over canyons,
        each higher and faster than the last. By the time you reach the bottom, you’re buzzing with adrenaline.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a slower pace, there’s always the glass-bottom boat tours, electric bike rentals, or just strolling
        Avalon’s waterfront shops. Carnival makes it easy to book in advance, but Catalina is also a port where
        you can comfortably wander on your own if you’d rather move at your own rhythm.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Ensenada -->
    <section class="mb-4">
      <figure class="float-end ms-3 mb-3" style="max-width: 380px;">
        <img src="assets/img/tacos.png" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Ensenada fish tacos street vendor">
        <figcaption class="mt-2 small text-muted">Fish tacos from a street cart in Ensenada — crispy, tender, and unforgettable.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2 class="h4">Ensenada: Baja Flavor and Culture</h2>
      <p>
        If Catalina feels like a playground, Ensenada feels like a feast. It’s Carnival’s classic Baja port,
        packed with food, history, and excursions that range from wine tours to adrenaline rides. I’d heard people
        call Ensenada a “budget” port, but I found it rich in flavor and atmosphere — the kind of place where one
        good taco can define your whole day.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">La Bufadora Blowhole</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most famous excursions is the trip to La Bufadora, a natural sea geyser that shoots water up to
        100 feet into the air as waves crash into a cave. The bus ride winds through desert hills before arriving at
        a cliffside market full of stalls selling blankets, silver jewelry, and street snacks. Watching the blowhole
        erupt is fun, but the street food — roasted corn, churros, and giant margaritas — was what made the trip
        memorable for me.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Wine Country Tours</h3>
      <p>
        Ensenada also sits near Mexico’s wine country, Valle de Guadalupe. Carnival offers wine tasting excursions
        that whisk you into the hills to sample local vintages at boutique wineries. Rolling vineyards under the sun
        felt a world away from the busy port. I tried rich reds paired with handmade cheeses, learning that Baja is
        now considered Mexico’s answer to Napa Valley.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Adventure on Land and Sea</h3>
      <p>
        For action seekers, Ensenada’s excursions deliver: ATV rides on dusty trails, horseback riding along the
        beach, or kayaking in the bay. I joined a small group horseback ride and found myself trotting past waves
        crashing on the sand. It was peaceful, exhilarating, and unlike anything I’d ever done before.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">DIY Ensenada: Walking, Tacos, and Shopping</h3>
      <p>
        You don’t need an excursion to enjoy Ensenada. The downtown area is walkable, lined with shops and taco
        stands. I ducked into a street cart and ordered fish tacos — crispy, tender, served with cabbage and crema.
        They cost less than $2 each and were better than any gourmet seafood dish I’ve had stateside. Between the
        food, the music spilling from cantinas, and the warm welcome of locals, Ensenada delivered as much culture
        as any guided tour.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Sea Day -->
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="h4">Sea Day: The Excursion Onboard</h2>
      <p>
        While not technically a “port excursion,” the sea day at the end of a 4-day cruise feels like one. It’s
        your chance to indulge in all the ship activities you skipped earlier. Carnival treats the ship itself as
        the destination, and the schedule bursts with trivia contests, spa specials, mixology classes, art
        auctions, and poolside games.
      </p>
      <p>
        On my sea day, I started with a late breakfast, lingered over coffee, and then joined a tequila tasting
        seminar that walked us through shots, margaritas, and pairing tips. In the afternoon, I finally tried
        the water slides I’d been avoiding all week, then spent an hour in the Serenity adults-only retreat with
        a book. That night, I went all-in on the onboard entertainment: comedy show, late-night pizza, and a deck
        party under the stars. It felt like its own kind of port day, just without leaving the ship.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reflections -->
    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="h4">How to Choose Excursions: My Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        With so many choices, it’s tempting to overbook. My advice: pick one big adventure per port, then leave
        time to wander. The beauty of Catalina and Ensenada is that both reward spontaneous exploration. Let the
        excursions give structure to your day, but don’t miss the joy of just soaking in the atmosphere with no
        schedule at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carnival makes it simple to book excursions through the app or before you sail. Booking with the ship
        costs more than going direct, but it comes with the peace of mind that the ship will wait if your tour
        runs late. If you’re comfortable on your own, local vendors often offer similar experiences at lower
        prices — just make sure to keep an eye on “ship time,” which doesn’t always match your phone’s clock.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="h4">Lasting Impressions</h2>
      <p>
        A four-day Mexican cruise may be short, but the excursions make it feel expansive. Catalina gave me a
        taste of island adventure; Ensenada delivered bold flavors and culture; the sea day reminded me the ship
        itself is a destination. Together, they created a rhythm of action and rest, surprise and comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next time I’ll probably try something different — maybe the zipline in Catalina or wine country in
        Ensenada. But even if I repeated the same excursions, I know each would feel fresh, because the sea has
        a way of making every experience feel new. That’s the magic of cruising: it’s never just about the
        destination. It’s about the stories you bring home, stitched together from sun, salt air, and a little
        adventure at every port.
